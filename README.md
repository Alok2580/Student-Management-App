# Student Management App  

This repository contains a **Student Management App**, a simple Java-based application to manage student records. The app leverages **JDBC** for database connectivity and uses **MySQL** for data storage. It provides functionality to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  

## Features  
- **Add Students**: Save new student details in the MySQL database.  
- **Update Records**: Modify existing student information.  
- **Delete Records**: Remove student records from the database.  
- **View Details**: Display all studentsâ€™ data in a tabular format.

Find the project code here: [Student Management App](https://github.com/Alok2580/Student-Management-App).  

## Prerequisites  
### Tools and Technologies  
- **Java**: Core programming language.  
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity.  
- **MySQL**: As the relational database system.  

Ensure you have:  
1. Java 8+ installed on your system.  
2. MySQL server running with appropriate user credentials.  

## File Descriptions  
- **`CP.java`**: Handles common database properties and configurations.  
- **`Start.java`**: The main entry point to launch the application.  
- **`Student.java`**: Represents the student entity, defining fields and methods for student records.  
- **`StudentDao.java`**: Data Access Object (DAO) for managing student-related database operations using JDBC.  

## Getting Started  
### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Alok2580/Student-Management-App.git  
   cd Student-Management-App  
   ```  

2. Set up the database:  
   - Create the required database schema using the provided SQL file (`schema.sql` if available).  
   - Update the `CP.java` file with your MySQL credentials (e.g., URL, username, password).  

3. Build the project:  
   ```bash  
   mvn clean install  
   ```  

### Running the App  
1. Start the application by running `Start.java`.  
2. Use the console-based menu to manage student records.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing or JavaFX.  
- Implement advanced search and filtering options.  
- Support exporting and importing data in CSV or Excel formats.
